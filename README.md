This project is a mini coding project that was done after taking a Software Engineering Fundamental Course held by RevoU start from April 10th, 2023 until April 19th,2023. This project is about deploying a school profile website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for client side. In this project, I also implement a responsive design. This is the preview of my website on desktop:

It is about high school profile, I named it “Horizon International High School” because I think it is a good name for high school. In the homepage, you will be asked to enter your name to be displayed in the welcome section (hero) and you can edit it as well. In the end of homepage, you can fill in the message form and your output can be seen in “Your Message Record” section. And please explore other pages too^^~

I realize that there are still many mistakes and lacks in my mini project. I really welcome your feedback, so that I can improve my skills and make a better performance in the next project.

Thank you!
